    "If you are going to write programs that do something with data, you do not want to hard-code all that data or have the user enter it again and again. You need to be able to write to and read from files.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a program is running, its data is in RAM - fast, volatile memory. Volatile means that the data disappears as soon as the program ends. Files are a way to organize data on slower, persistent media (e.g. a disk, USB, etc). This data will stay there when the program is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with files is a lot like working with a notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A file has to be opened. \n",
    "- When you are done, it has to be closed. \n",
    "- While the file is open, it can either be read from or written to. \n",
    "- Like a bookmark, the file keeps track of where you are reading to or writing from. \n",
    "- You can read the whole file in its natural order or you can skip around. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening and Closing a File\n",
